      <!-- I was trying to build or create a triangle with billiard balls to scale and a pool table here-->
      <!-- There was a LOT OF MATH I did for this, but it still did not come out right-->
      <!-- I had to figure out where the origin was in relation to the pool table surface, as well as how the balls should be placed-->
      <!-- This required multiple translations along the x and z since to keep the balls the same dimensions I could only go up 1.25 along the y-axis-->
      <!-- I slowly learned that you needed to assume that if you are using spheres, then you think about where the objects are in regards from the center. -->
      <!-- The center is where the coordinates really matter, much like the standard equation of a circle in analytic geometry-->
