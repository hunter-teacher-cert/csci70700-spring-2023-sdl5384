In the transpositionEncryption python script, I attempted to write a code that would ask for a message, and then place it in a predetermined box or list, depending on the size of the message as well as the number of rows requested.

I wanted it to store the message by writing it from the top left toward the right down.  Unfortunatley, after all this time it is a still a work in progress.  At the same time I wanted to try to encrypt it by inverting or transposing the matrix so that way Python would just read it from the first column down and then to the right instead of all the way across the rows.

I have been having difficulty with trying to get the indices to work with my two dimensional list.
